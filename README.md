# MicroGame2025
Code for an arduino based handheld game system.

This was built using a Seeed Studio Xiao SAMD21 microcontroller. It may work with other microcontrollers, but you will need to make adjustments to the pin assignments within the code to make that work.

Recommend way to use this code:
* download the VS Code editor
* install the PlatformIO extension
* compile and upload the code to your microcontroller through PlatformIO
